# NextGenies — Digital Growth Agency

NextGenies is a high-performance digital growth agency web application built with a modern React 19 frontend and an Express 5 / MySQL backend. The platform combines a refined minimalist neumorphic & glassmorphic design system, an interactive multi-step project questionnaire, case studies, FAQ rich-snippet SEO schema, a complete journal/blog system, and a JWT-secured admin workspace.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### Frontend & Experience
* **Minimalist Neumorphic & Glassmorphic Design System**: Tactile neumorphic surfaces with soft, natural ambient shadows and crisp frosted-glass materials (`tokens.css`).
* **Zero-Glare Color Palette**: Carefully calibrated light (`#edf1f5`) and dark (`#15181f`) themes with a refined indigo accent (`#4355b9` / `#6574cc`) eliminating harsh white or neon glare.
* **Reactive Dark/Light Mode**: Subscribed via React 19 `useSyncExternalStore` for flicker-free theme detection with an animated sun/moon toggle and pre-paint local storage hydration.
* **Proven Outcomes & Case Studies**: Live metric cards showcasing client impact across content, web development, and branding.
* **Interactive FAQ Accordion**: Expandable Q&A with Schema.org `FAQPage` structured data for search engine rich snippets.
* **Scroll-Driven Services Stack**: Interactive pinned card stack on `/services` showing core deliverables with smooth progress tracking and reduced-motion fallbacks.
* **Interactive 9-Step Questionnaire (`/contact`)**:
  * Step-by-step project discovery wizard with keyboard accessibility and auto-focus management.
  * **Session Storage Draft Persistence**: Answers and step positions automatically survive accidental page refreshes.
  * Direct WhatsApp and email escape hatches for visitors wanting immediate contact.
* **Journal & Insights Engine (`/blogs`)**:
  * Category filtering and live search.
  * Social sharing buttons and reading time calculations.
  * Prerendered static blog pages for maximum SEO crawlability.
* **Mobile-First Responsiveness**: Handcrafted fluid layouts across narrow screens (320px–480px), tablets (768px–900px), and desktops, with touch-scrollable chip drawers and auto-fitting CTAs.

### Backend & CMS
* **Protected Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)**: JWT-authenticated management portal for writing, publishing, editing, and deleting articles.
* **Database-Backed Media Storage**: Image uploads stored safely in MySQL `MEDIUMBLOB` columns, ensuring persistence across cloud container redeployments.
* **Transactional Email Alerts**: Optional SMTP notifications sent to multiple agency inboxes upon project brief submissions.
* **Security & Hardening**: Helmet HTTP headers, CORS origin restrictions, rate-limiting on sensitive endpoints, and strict input validation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
* **npm**: v9.0.0 or higher
* **MySQL**: v8.0 or compatible database instance

### 2. Frontend Installation & Configuration

1. In the root directory, install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create your frontend environment file (do not commit it):
   ```bash
   # Create a file named .env in the project root
   ```

   If `.env.example` is not present in your checkout, create `.env` manually.
3. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_SITE_URL=https://nextgenies.com
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

   For a local same-origin setup, `VITE_API_URL` can be left blank when the
   backend is serving the frontend. For production, use the public API URL
   described in [Hostinger deployment](#hostinger-deployment).

### 3. Backend Installation & Configuration

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=nextgenies_db
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password

   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

   FRONTEND_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
   PORT=5000

   # Optional SMTP credentials for lead notification emails
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
   EMAIL_FROM=NextGenies <no-reply@nextgenies.com>
   EMAIL_TO=team@nextgenies.com
   ```

3. Generate a secure random JWT secret:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

### 4. Running Locally

* **Run Backend** (terminal 1):
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm run dev
  ```
  *The backend automatically connects to MySQL and creates the `contacts` and `blogs` tables on startup.*

* **Run Frontend** (terminal 2):
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  *Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.*

## 🚢 Hostinger Deployment

The recommended Hostinger setup runs the Express backend and the built
frontend in one Node.js application. The backend serves `dist/`, the API is
available under `/api`, and the website and API use the same origin:

```text
https://nextgenies.com
https://nextgenies.com/api/health
```

### 1. Create the Hostinger database

In hPanel, create a MySQL database and user, then grant the user access to
the database. Record the exact database host, name, username, password, and
port. The backend creates the `contacts` and `blogs` tables on first startup.

The local SQLite file is not migrated automatically. Export or manually
recreate any local blog posts and contacts that must be retained.

### 2. Configure production environment variables

Set these values in Hostinger's Node.js environment settings or in a private
`backend/.env` file. Never place secrets in `public/` or commit them.

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

VITE_SITE_URL=https://nextgenies.com
VITE_API_URL=
SEO_API_URL=https://nextgenies.com

DB_HOST=your_hostinger_mysql_host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

ADMIN_USERNAME=your_real_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_long_unique_admin_password
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret

FRONTEND_ORIGINS=https://nextgenies.com,https://www.nextgenies.com

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email_address
SMTP_PASS=your_google_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=NextGenies <your_email_address>
EMAIL_TO=your_business_email
```

Generate a JWT secret with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

The API process can start while MySQL is unavailable, but `/api/health` reports
degraded readiness and data operations fail closed. Admin login also fails
closed unless all admin credentials and a 32-character-or-longer JWT secret are
configured. Do not use development credentials in production.

### 3. Build the application

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The build creates `dist/`, route-specific prerendered HTML, `dist/robots.txt`,
and `dist/sitemap.xml`. If published blog posts should be included in the
build-time sitemap and prerendered pages, make the production API available
at `SEO_API_URL` while running the build. The backend sitemap remains dynamic
after deployment.

Install backend dependencies as well:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Configure the Hostinger Node.js application

In hPanel, create or configure the Node.js application with:

```text
Application root: repository root (the folder containing package.json and vite.config.js)
Startup file: backend/server.js
Environment: production
Node.js: 20 or newer
```

Do not set the application root to the `backend/` subfolder. Its separate
`package.json` has no frontend `build` script and does not install Vite. The
root package manifest is required for `npm run build` and the generated
`dist/` folder.

Build `dist/` during deployment, before starting the Node.js application. The
server does not run npm or Vite at startup. If `dist/index.html` is missing,
the API can still start but website routes return 503 until a build is deployed.
Hostinger's static **Publish** mode serves `dist/` only and does not start
Express; choose a Node.js application for the combined frontend/API setup, or
keep the frontend static and configure it to call a separately running backend.
Do not upload `node_modules/`, `.env`, `backend/.env`, `.git/`, or local
database files unless you intentionally migrate their data.

Restart the Node.js application after setting environment variables.

### 5. Configure the domain and HTTPS

Point `nextgenies.com` and, if required, `www.nextgenies.com` to the
Hostinger application. Enable SSL and force HTTPS. The canonical site URL
used by this project is `https://nextgenies.com`; redirect the `www` version
to it if that is your chosen primary domain.

If Hostinger requires a separate API subdomain instead, use:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.nextgenies.com
SEO_API_URL=https://api.nextgenies.com
FRONTEND_ORIGINS=https://nextgenies.com,https://www.nextgenies.com
```

Never set a production `VITE_API_URL` or `SEO_API_URL` to `localhost`; a
visitor's browser would interpret that as their own computer. If frontend and
backend share one origin, leave `VITE_API_URL` empty. After signing in to
`/admin`, open the **System** tab to check MySQL, SMTP, CORS origins, and build
readiness; the SMTP check verifies connectivity only and does not send mail.

### 6. Verify the live deployment

Check these URLs after the application starts:

```text
https://nextgenies.com/
https://nextgenies.com/services/
https://nextgenies.com/blogs/
https://nextgenies.com/robots.txt
https://nextgenies.com/sitemap.xml
https://nextgenies.com/api/health
```

The health endpoint should return `"status": "ok"` and `"database": "mysql"`.
Also test the contact form, admin login at `/admin`, blog creation and image
upload, publishing, email delivery, mobile layouts, HTTPS redirects, and both
`www` and non-`www` hostnames.

## 📈 Google Analytics

The Google tag is included in `index.html`. Confirm that its Measurement ID
belongs to the intended Google Analytics 4 web data stream before deploying.
If it must be changed, update the `G-XXXXXXXXXX` value in `index.html` and
run `npm run build` again.

After deployment:

1. Open Google Analytics and select the correct GA4 property.
2. Open **Reports → Realtime**.
3. Visit the live website in another browser or a private window.
4. Confirm that the visit and page views appear.

The application also sends SPA route changes and selected interaction events
through `src/lib/analytics.js`.

## 🔎 Google Search Console

1. Open Google Search Console and add a **Domain** property for:
   `nextgenies.com`.
2. Copy the TXT verification record provided by Google.
3. Add the TXT record in Hostinger DNS.
4. Wait for DNS propagation and click **Verify**.
5. Keep the TXT record in DNS after verification.
6. Open **Sitemaps** and submit:
   `https://nextgenies.com/sitemap.xml`
7. Use **URL Inspection** for the home page and request indexing.

Before submitting, confirm that `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, canonical tags,
page titles, descriptions, and HTTPS redirects all use the production domain.
